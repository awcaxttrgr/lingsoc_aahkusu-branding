# Linguistics Society, AAHKUSU Branding Portal
Welcome to the branding portal of Linguistics Society, AAHKUSU!
Here you can find the guidelines on how to use the new society identity, and templates to let you get started quickly.

This site is ported from Google Sites in 2021 due to the migration of HKU Connect from Google to Microsoft.

In the future, a more accessible page will be available on https://awcaxttrgr.github.io/lingsoc_aahkusu-branding/, but for now please bear with the GitHub repository.
