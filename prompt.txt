The Linguistics Societyâ€™s visual identity revolves around its logotype, which combines two core elements: the Globe and the Signature. The primary lock-up is the default and preferred version, featuring a horizontal arrangement of the Globe and Signature. It should be used whenever possible across publications, banners, and digital media. When horizontal space is limited, the secondary lock-up, which stacks the Globe and Signature vertically, is allowed.

Language variants include English, Chinese, and bilingual versions. English is preferred unless context requires Chinese or both.

Several colour and background variants exist:

Standard full-colour: Always preferred when colour printing is possible.
Negative variant: For dark, complex, or vibrant backgrounds where the standard version lacks contrast.
Greyscale variant: For black-and-white printing, ensuring clarity without halftone effects.
Monochromatic variant: For single-colour designs, where the logotype is adapted to one colour from the palette.

Additional adaptations include:

Session suffix: The logotype can include a session period using Fira Sans Bold (English) or Noto Sans CJK TC Medium (Chinese), aligned according to templates.
